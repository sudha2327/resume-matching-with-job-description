🧠 Resume Matcher Project
This project is a simple yet powerful tool that matches a candidate's resume with the most relevant job descriptions using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

🚀 Features
Upload your resume as a .txt file.

Automatically compares your resume content with a list of job descriptions.

Highlights the top matching job roles based on keyword similarity.

Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing.

Built using Python, NLTK, scikit-learn, and IPython Widgets.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 🐍

NLTK (for tokenization, stopwords, and lemmatization)

scikit-learn (TF-IDF and cosine similarity)

ipywidgets (for interactive file upload in notebooks)

🧪 How It Works
Upload your resume as a text file.

The script cleans and tokenizes both the resume and job descriptions.

TF-IDF vectorizer converts text into numerical vectors.

Cosine similarity is calculated to find the best-matching job role.

The job title and description of the closest match are printed.

📌 How To Run
Open the notebook in Jupyter or use the .py script.

Make sure jb_df.csv and sample_resume.txt are in the same folder.

Run the notebook cells or the script.

Upload your resume when prompted.
